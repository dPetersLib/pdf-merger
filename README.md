Activate the virtual environment you created using;              
  
    Linux/OS: 
   
                $ source <virtual-environment-name>/Scripts/activate
              
    Windows OS:
   
                C:\Users\Name\<project-directory> path\to\<virtual-environment-name>\Scripts\activate
  
Install the required dependencies using;

                pip install -r requirements.txt
